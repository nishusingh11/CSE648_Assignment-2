# CSE648_Assignment-2

In this assignment, I'm creating a simple inventory management system.

Set Up
Before beginning this assignment, make sure that your project is set up correctly:
-Create a repo in GitHub called “assignment2”.
-Clone that repo locally and then open it within your code editor.
-Perform all of the same steps that you completed in assignment1 to get your project running under 
localhost:3000. You should have the same folder structure, same server.js file, etc. that you had in assignment1 
as well.
